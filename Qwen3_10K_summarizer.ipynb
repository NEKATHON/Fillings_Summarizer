            "FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES INDEX TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 19, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Jacksonville, Florida February 19, 2019 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01 As discussed in Note S to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for equity investments with readily determinable fair values in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017 Jacksonville, Florida February 19, 2019 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Fidelity National Financial, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Earnings, Equity, and Cash Flows of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016 (collectively, the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following describes the business and significant accounting policies of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” the \"Company\" or “FNF”) which have been followed in preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Description of Business We are a leading provider of (i) title insurance, escrow and other title-related services, including trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances and home warranty products and (ii) technology and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries. FNF is one of the nation’s largest title insurance companies operating through its title insurance underwriters - Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (\"FNTIC\"), Chicago Title Insurance Company (\"Chicago Title\"), Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (\"Commonwealth Title\"), Alamo Title Insurance and National Title Insurance of New York Inc. - which collectively issue more title insurance policies than any other title company in the United States. Through our subsidiary, ServiceLink Holdings, LLC (\"ServiceLink\"), we provide mortgage transaction services, including title-related services and facilitation of production and management of mortgage loans. For information on businesses comprising our reportable segments, refer to Note R Segment Information. Recent Developments Pending Acquisition of Stewart On March 18, 2018, we signed a merger agreement (the \"Merger Agreement\") to acquire Stewart Information Services Corporation (\"Stewart\") (NYSE: STC) (the \"Stewart Merger\"), pursuant to which each share of Stewart common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Stewart Merger (other than shares owned by Stewart, its subsidiaries, FNF or the wholly-owned subsidiaries of FNF party to the Merger Agreement and shares in respect of which appraisal rights have been properly exercised and perfected under Delaware law), will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share, (i) $50.00 in cash, (ii) 1.2850 shares of FNF common stock, or (iii) $25.00 in cash and 0.6425 shares of FNF common stock, subject to potential adjustment (as described below) and proration to the extent the option to receive cash or the option to receive stock is oversubscribed. FNF currently intends to fund the $1.2 billion purchase price, 50% in cash and 50% in FNF common stock, through a combination of cash on hand at FNF, the issuance of FNF common stock to Stewart stockholders, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if necessary. Including the assumption of $109 million of Stewart's debt, our pro forma debt to total capital ratio is expected to be no more than approximately 20% at the close of the Stewart Merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the combined company is required to divest assets or businesses for which 2017 annual revenues exceed $75 million, up to a cap of $225 million, in order to receive required regulatory approvals, the purchase price will be adjusted down on a pro-rata basis to a minimum purchase price of $45.50 per share of common stock of Stewart. If the Stewart Merger is not completed for failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we would be required to pay a reverse break-up fee of $50 million to Stewart. On May 31, 2018, we received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a “Second Request,” from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) in connection with the FTC’s Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), regulatory review of the Stewart Merger.We continue to work through the regulatory process for the Stewart Merger and are currently engaged in responding to the Second Request related to the FTC's HSR Act regulatory review of the transaction. Responses to nearly all the FTC's requests for information and documentation have been submitted. From December 29, 2018 through January 25, 2019, the FTC suspended its review of the Stewart Merger and the materials related thereto due to a lapse in government funding caused by a partial shutdown of the U.S. Federal Government, potentially creating significant backlog when the FTC resumed its operations on January 28, 2019. As such, we are unable to determine the extent of any such delay in the FTC’s review. On August 1, 2018, our registration statement on Form S-4 related to the Stewart Merger was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). On August 21, 2018, we received a “no-action letter” from the Canadian Competition Bureau (the “Bureau”), indicating that the Bureau does not intend to oppose the completion of the Stewart Merger. The special meeting of Stewart stockholders to vote on the Stewart Merger was held on September 5, 2018 and a majority of the Stewart stockholders voted to approve the Stewart Merger. More than 99% of the votes cast, representing approximately 79% of the outstanding shares of Stewart common stock as of July 10, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, were cast in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) We have filed applications regarding acquisition of control of the Stewart domestic insurers with the states of Texas and New York. The Texas application regarding acquisition of control of Stewart Title Guaranty Company, a Texas domiciled title insurance company licensed in 48 states, is under review by the Texas Department of Insurance. On January 31, 2019, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) provided written notice to us of its disapproval of our application to acquire control of Stewart Title Insurance Company, a New York domiciled title insurance company that is licensed only in the State of New York. Receipt of approval from the NYDFS is a condition to closing the Stewart Merger. FNF and Stewart are evaluating the appropriate course of action in light of the NYDFS’ determination, which may include a discussion with the NYDFS to better understand its concerns and respond to the letter. Through January 31, 2019, we have received 28 Form E state regulatory approvals relating to the Stewart Merger. The closing of the Stewart Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Other Developments On September 24, 2018, we closed on the sale of all of our 62% equity interest in, and notes outstanding from, Pacific Union International, Inc. (\"Pacific Union\"), a luxury real estate broker based in California, and its subsidiaries to Urban Compass, Inc. (\"Compass\") for $37 million in cash and up to $21 million in potential earnout payments (the \"Pacific Union Sale\"). The potential earnout payments range in value from $0 to $21 million, are based on certain gross profit and earnings targets for Pacific Union and are payable in approximately 60% cash and 40% Compass stock annually over the course of the next 3 years. Compass was not a related party prior to, and is not a related party subsequent to, the Pacific Union Sale. On August 13, 2018, we completed an offering of $450 million in aggregate principal amount of notes due August 2028 with stated interest of 4.50%. See Note E. Notes Payable for further details. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and include our accounts as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated. Our investments in non-majority-owned partnerships and affiliates are accounted for using the equity method until such time that they become wholly or majority-owned. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings relating to majority-owned subsidiaries with the appropriate noncontrolling interest that represents the portion of equity not related to our ownership interest recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in each period. Investments Fixed maturity securities are purchased to support our investment strategies, which are developed based on factors including rate of return, maturity, credit risk, duration, tax considerations and regulatory requirements. Fixed maturity securities which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies are carried at fair value and are classified as available for sale as of the balance sheet dates. Fair values for fixed maturity securities are principally a function of current market conditions and are valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Discount or premium is recorded for the difference between the purchase price and the principal amount. The discount or premium is amortized or accrued using the interest method and is recorded as an adjustment to interest and investment income. The interest method results in the recognition of a constant rate of return on the investment equal to the prevailing rate at the time of purchase or at the time of subsequent adjustments of book value. Changes in prepayment assumptions are accounted for retrospectively. Equity and preferred securities held are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet dates. Our equity and certain preferred securities are Level 1 financial assets and fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets. Other preferred stock holdings are Level 2 financial assets and are valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are recorded using the equity method of accounting. Other long-term investments consist of other investments and company-owned life insurance policies. Other investments are carried at fair value. See Note C Fair Value Measurements for further discussion of other investments. Company-owned life insurance policies are carried at cash surrender value. Short-term investments, which consist primarily of commercial paper and money market instruments, which have an original maturity of one year or less, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of the cost of the specific investments sold and are credited or charged to income on a trade date basis. Beginning January 1, 2018, unrealized gains or losses on equity and preferred securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity securities (and equity and preferred FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) securities prior to January 1, 2018) which are classified as available for sale, net of applicable deferred income tax expenses (benefits), are excluded from earnings and credited or charged directly to a separate component of equity. If any unrealized losses on available for sale securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, such unrealized losses are recognized as realized losses. Unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities are considered other-than-temporary if factors exist that cause us to believe that the value will not increase to a level sufficient to recover our cost basis. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary include: (i) our need and intent to sell the investment prior to a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value; (ii) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; and (iii) the financial condition and prospects of the issuer. Such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss. See Note S. Recent Accounting Pronouncements for discussion of ASU No. 2016-01 which changed the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on equity and preferred securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents Highly liquid instruments purchased as part of cash management with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these instruments approximate their fair value. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair values of financial instruments presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements are estimates of the fair values at a specific point in time using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. We do not necessarily intend to dispose of or liquidate such instruments prior to maturity. Trade and Notes Receivables The carrying values reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for trade and notes receivables approximate their fair value. Premium revenues from agency title operations are recognized when the underlying title order and transaction closing, if applicable, are complete and reported to us. Premium revenues from agency operations and related commissions include an accrual based on estimates using historical information of the volume of transactions that have closed in a particular period for which premiums have not yet been reported to us from independent agents. Historically, the time lag between the closing of these transactions by our agents and the reporting of these policies, or premiums, to us has been up to 15 months, with 88% - 95% reported within three months following closing, an additional 3% - 8% reported within the next three months and the remainder within seven to fifteen months. In addition to accruing these earned but unreported agency premiums, we also accrue agent commission expense, which was 76.5%, of agent premiums earned in 2018, 76.7% of agent premiums earned in 2017, and 76.1% of agent premiums earned in 2016. The amount due from our agents relating to this accrual, i.e., the agent premium less their contractual retained commission, was approximately $44 million and $55 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Due to the offsetting effects of reversing prior period accruals, the impact of this accrual to our recorded Agency title insurance premiums, Agent commissions and net earnings in any given period is not considered material. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis based on a review of qualitative factors to determine if events and circumstances exist which will lead to a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, prior to performing a full fair-value assessment. We completed annual goodwill impairment analyses in the fourth quarter of each period presented using a September 30 measurement date. As a result of the analysis, $3 million of goodwill impairment related to a real estate brokerage reporting unit in our Corporate and other segment was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined there were no events or circumstances which indicated that the carrying value exceeded the fair value. See Note F. Goodwill. Other Intangible Assets We have other intangible assets, not including goodwill, which consist primarily of customer relationships and contracts, trademarks and tradenames, and computer software, which are generally recorded in connection with acquisitions at their fair value. Intangible assets with estimable lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) recoverable. In general, customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ten years, using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates. Contractual relationships are generally amortized over their contractual life. Trademarks and tradenames are generally amortized over ten years. Capitalized software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life, ranging from five to ten years. For internal-use computer software products, internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as they are incurred. Internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date the software is ready for its intended use. We do not capitalize any costs once the software is ready for its intended use. We recorded $3 million, $1 million and $1 million in impairment expense to other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impairment in 2018 primarily relates to an acquired customer relationship asset in our Title segment. The impairment in 2017 was for computer software at ServiceLink. The impairment in 2016 was for customer relationships and tradenames at our real estate subsidiaries in our Corporate and Other segment. Title Plants Title plants are recorded at the cost incurred to construct or obtain and organize historical title information to the point it can be used to perform title searches. Costs incurred to maintain, update and operate title plants are expensed as incurred. Title plants are not amortized as they are considered to have an indefinite life if maintained. Sales of title plants are reported at the amount received net of the adjusted costs of the title plant sold. Sales of title plant copies are reported at the amount received. No cost is allocated to the sale of copies of title plants unless the carrying value of the title plant is diminished or impaired. Title plants are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We reviewed title plants for impairment but recorded no impairment expense related to title plants in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets: twenty to thirty years for buildings and three to twenty-five years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of such assets. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Reserve for Title Claim Losses Our reserve for title claim losses includes known claims as well as losses we expect to incur, net of recoupments. Each known claim is reserved based on our review as to the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim. Reserves for claims which are incurred but not reported are established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on historical loss experience and also take into consideration other factors, including industry trends, claim loss history, current legal environment, geographic considerations and the type of policy written. The reserve for title claim losses also includes reserves for losses arising from closing and disbursement functions due to fraud or operational error. If a loss is related to a policy issued by an independent agent, we may proceed against the independent agent pursuant to the terms of the agency agreement. In any event, we may proceed against third parties who are responsible for any loss under the title insurance policy under rights of subrogation. Secured Trust Deposits In the state of Illinois, a trust company is permitted to commingle and invest customers’ assets with its own assets, pending completion of real estate transactions. Accordingly, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a secured trust deposit liability of $822 million and $830 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing customers’ assets held by us and corresponding assets including cash and investments pledged as security for those trust balances. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, is applied FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial statements in the period enacted. Reinsurance In a limited number of situations, we limit our maximum loss exposure by reinsuring certain risks with other insurers. We also earn a small amount of additional income, which is reflected in our direct premiums, by assuming reinsurance for certain risks of other insurers. We cede a portion of certain policy and other liabilities under agent fidelity, excess of loss and case-by-case reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance agreements provide that in the event of a loss (including costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses) exceeding the retained amounts, the reinsurer is liable for the excess amount assumed. However, the ceding company remains primarily liable in the event the reinsurer does not meet its contractual obligations. Revenue Recognition Refer to Note T. Revenue Recognition for a description of our accounting for our various revenue streams. Discontinued Operations On November 17, 2017, we completed our previously announced split-off (the “FNFV Split-Off”) of our former wholly-owned subsidiary Cannae Holdings, Inc. (“Cannae”) which consisted of the businesses, assets and liabilities formerly attributed to our FNF Ventures (\"FNFV\") Group including Ceridian Holding, LLC, American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC and T-System Holding LLC. The FNFV Split-Off was accomplished by the Company's redemption (the “Redemption”) of all of the outstanding shares of FNFV Group common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“FNFV common stock”) for outstanding shares of common stock of Cannae, par value $0.0001 per share (“Cannae common stock”), amounting to a redemption of each outstanding share of FNFV common stock for one share of Cannae common stock, as of November 17, 2017. As a result of the FNFV Split-Off, Cannae became a separate, publicly-traded company (NYSE: CNNE) as of November 20, 2017. All of the Company’s core title insurance, real estate, technology and mortgage related businesses, assets and liabilities currently attributed to the Company’s FNF common stock that were not held by Cannae remain with the Company. As a result of the FNFV Split-Off, the financial results of FNFV Group have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. On September 29, 2017 we completed our tax-free distribution to FNF shareholders of all 83.3 million shares of New BKH Corp. (\"New BKH\") common stock that we previously owned (the “BK Distribution”). Immediately following the BK Distribution, New BKH and Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. (\"Black Knight\") engaged in a series of transactions resulting in the formation of a new publicly traded holding company, Black Knight, Inc. (\"New Black Knight\"). Holders of FNF common stock received approximately 0.30663 shares of New Black Knight common stock for every one share of FNF common stock held at the close of business on September 20, 2017, the record date for the BK Distribution. New Black Knight's common stock is now listed under the symbol “BKI” on the New York Stock Exchange. The BK Distribution was generally tax-free to FNF shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of New Black Knight's fractional shares. As a result of the BK Distribution, the financial results of Black Knight have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Note G. Discontinued Operations for further details of the results and financial position of FNFV and Black Knight. Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) We report Comprehensive earnings (loss) in accordance with GAAP on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings. Total comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders. While total comprehensive earnings is the activity in a period and is largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other comprehensive earnings or loss represents the cumulative balance of other comprehensive earnings, net of tax, as of the balance sheet date. Amounts reclassified to net earnings relate to the realized gains (losses) on our investments and other financial instruments, excluding investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and are included in Realized gains and losses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Changes in the balance of Other comprehensive earnings (loss) by component are as follows: Redeemable Non-controlling Interest Subsequent to our acquisition of Lender Processing Services, Inc. (\"LPS\") in January 2014, we issued a 35% ownership interest in ServiceLink to funds affiliated with Thomas H. Lee Partners (\"THL\" or \"the minority interest holder\"). THL has an option to put its ownership interests of ServiceLink to us if no public offering of the corresponding business was consummated after four years from the date of FNF's purchase of LPS. The units owned by THL (the \"redeemable noncontrolling interests\") may be settled in cash or common stock of FNF or a combination of both at our election. As of January 2018, no public offering was made and the redeemable noncontrolling interests were no longer subject to a holding requirement. The redeemable noncontrolling interests will be settled at the current fair value at the time we receive notice of THL's put election as determined by the parties or by a third party appraisal under the terms of the Unit Purchase Agreement. As a result of a recapitalization of ServiceLink in 2015, the ownership interest by the minority interest holder was reduced from 35% to 21%. As of December 31, 2018, the redeemable noncontrolling interests have a fair value of approximately $194 million and we do not believe the exercise of their remaining put right in ServiceLink to be probable. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at their initial value of $344 million in our consolidated balance sheets and would be adjusted to fair value were such value to rise above the initial value. As these redeemable noncontrolling interests provide for redemption features not solely within our control, we classify the redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests held by third parties in subsidiaries owned or controlled by FNF is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet outside of permanent equity; and the Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects the respective redeemable noncontrolling interests in Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, the effect of which is removed from the net earnings attributable to Fidelity National Financial, Inc. common shareholders. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share, as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In periods when earnings are positive, diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the impact of assumed conversions of potentially dilutive securities. For periods when we recognize a net loss, diluted earnings per share is equal to basic earnings per share as the impact of assumed conversions of potentially dilutive securities is considered to be antidilutive. We have granted certain stock options, shares of restricted stock, convertible debt instruments and certain other convertible share based payments which have been treated as common share equivalents for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for periods in which positive earnings have been reported. Restricted stock, options or other instruments which provide the ability to acquire shares of our common stock that are antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) no antidilutive shares were outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2016 options to purchase two million shares of our common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to our former FNFV group common stock for the 2017 period were calculated using weighted average shares outstanding through the date of the FNFV Split-off, November 17, 2017. Stock-Based Compensation Plans We account for stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method. Using the fair value method of accounting, compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date, using the Black-Scholes Model, and recognized over the service period. Management Estimates The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2017 and 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to classifications used in 2018. These reclassifications have not changed net earnings or total equity, as previously reported. See Note G. Discontinued Operations for further information on reclassifications related to disposed businesses. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note B. Acquisitions The results of operations and financial position of the entities acquired during any year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from and after the date of acquisition. Title Title Guaranty of Hawaii On August 31, 2017, FNF completed its acquisition of 90% of the membership interest of Title Guaranty of Hawaii (\"Title Guaranty\") for $98 million. Title Guaranty was previously an unaffiliated agent and will continue to be closely aligned with Chicago Title as part of the FNF title company family. Founded in 1896, Title Guaranty is the oldest title company in the State of Hawaii and is a leading provider of title and escrow services, with more than 300 employees in branches across the State of Hawaii providing title insurance and real estate closing services. The acquisition does not meet the definition of \"significant\" pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation S-X (§210.3-05). Further, the results of operations are not material to our historical financial statements. We paid total consideration, net of cash received, of $93 million in exchange for 90% of the equity interests of Title Guaranty. The total cash consideration paid was as follows (in millions): The purchase price has been allocated to Title Guaranty's assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimates of their fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill has been recorded based on the amount that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

(\"SS\"), respectively (together, the \"Real Estate Technology Acquisitions\"). The Real Estate Technology Acquisitions were made to supplement our Commissions, Inc. (\"CINC\") business. The Real Estate Technology Acquisitions do not meet the definition of \"significant\", individually or in the aggregate, pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation S-X (§210.3-05). Further, their historical results of operations are not material to our financial statements. CINC and FNF paid total aggregate consideration, net of cash received, of $98 million in exchange for 100% and 67% of the equity interests of RG and SS, respectively. The total consideration paid was as follows (in millions): The purchase price has been allocated to the Real Estate Technology Acquisitions' assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimates of their fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill has been recorded based on the amount that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. $39 million of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note C. Fair Value Measurements The fair value hierarchy established by the accounting standards on fair value measurements includes three levels which are based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities that are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access. Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on model inputs that are unobservable. The following table presents our fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: Our Level 2 fair value measures for preferred and fixed-maturity securities available for sale are provided by a third-party pricing service. We utilize one firm for our preferred securities and our bond portfolios. The pricing service is a leading global provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. We rely on one price for each instrument to determine the carrying amount of the assets on our balance sheet. The inputs utilized in these pricing methodologies include observable measures such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. We review the pricing methodologies for all of our Level 2 securities by obtaining an understanding of the valuation models and assumptions used by the third-party. When FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) available and for certain investments, we independently compare the resulting prices to other publicly available measures of fair value and internally developed models. The pricing methodologies used by the relevant third-party pricing services are as follows: • U.S. government and agencies: These securities are valued based on data obtained for similar securities in active markets and from inter-dealer brokers. • State and political subdivisions: These securities are valued based on data obtained for similar securities in active markets and from inter-dealer brokers. Factors considered include relevant trade information, dealer quotes and other relevant market data. • Corporate debt securities: These securities are valued based on dealer quotes and related market trading activity. Factors considered include the bond's yield, its terms and conditions, or any other feature which may influence its risk and thus marketability, as well as relative credit information and relevant sector news. • Foreign government bonds: These securities are valued based on a discounted cash flow model incorporating observable market inputs such as available broker quotes and yields of comparable securities. • Mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities: These securities are comprised of commercial mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities. They are valued based on available trade information, dealer quotes, cash flows, relevant indices and market data for similar assets in active markets. • Preferred securities: Preferred securities are valued by calculating the appropriate spread over a comparable US Treasury security. Inputs include benchmark quotes and other relevant market data. In conjunction with our adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, beginning January 1, 2018, we began recording certain preferred equity investments included in other long term investments at fair value which were previously accounted for as cost method investments. See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note S. Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further information on the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01. Our Level 3 fair value measures for our other long term investment are provided by a third-party pricing service. We utilize one firm to value our Level 3 other long-term investment. The pricing service is a leading global provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. We utilize the income approach and a discounted cash flow analysis in determining the fair value of our Level 3 other long-term investment. The primary unobservable input utilized in this pricing methodology is the discount rate used which is determined based on underwriting yield, credit spreads, yields on benchmark indices, and comparable public company debt. The discount rate used in our determination of the fair value of our Level 3 other long-term investment as of December 31, 2018 was a range of 8.4% - 8.8% and a weighted-average of 8.6%. Based on the total fair value of our Level 3 other long-term investment as of December 31, 2018, changes in the discount rate utilized will not result in a fair value significantly different than the amount recorded. The following table presents a summary of the changes in the fair values of Level 3 assets, measured on a recurring basis, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. ___________________________________________ (1) See Note S. Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion. (2) Included in Interest and investment income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (3) Included in Realized gains and losses, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings Transfers into or out of the Level 3 fair value category occur when unobservable inputs become more or less significant to the fair value measurement or upon a change in valuation technique. For the year ended December 31, 2018, transfers between FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Level 2 and Level 3 were based on changes in significance of unobservable inputs used associated with a change in the valuation technique used for certain of the Company’s corporate debt securities and are not considered material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. As of December 31, 2017 we held no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs. There were no transfers of assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs to Level 2 in the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. Substantially all of the unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other financial instruments, net (excluding investments in unconsolidated affiliates) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relate to fixed maturity securities which are considered Level 2 fair value measures. The carrying amounts of short-term investments, accounts receivable and notes receivable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of our notes payable is included in Note J Notes Payable. Additional information regarding the fair value of our investment portfolio is included in Note D Investments. Note D. Investments The carrying amounts and fair values of our available for sale securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: The cost basis of fixed maturity securities available for sale includes an adjustment for amortized premium or discount since the date of purchase. In conjunction with our adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, beginning January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses on equity and preferred securities are included in Realized gains and losses, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Accordingly, they are excluded from the table as of December 31, 2018 above. Refer to Note S. Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion of the effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-01. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) The change in net unrealized gains and (losses) on fixed maturities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was an increase (decrease) of $(21) million, (1) million, and $13 million, respectively. The following table presents certain information regarding contractual maturities of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2018: Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Fixed maturity securities valued at approximately $122 million and $128 million were on deposit with various governmental authorities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as required by law. Net unrealized losses on investment securities and the fair value of the related securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in millions): The unrealized losses for the corporate debt securities and U.S. government bonds were primarily caused by fluctuations in interest rates. The unrealized losses for the foreign government bonds were primarily caused by foreign exchange fluctuations. We consider the unrealized losses related to these securities to be temporary rather than changes in credit quality. We expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of our temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities as we do not intend to sell these securities and we do not believe that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity securities before recovery of the cost basis. For these reasons, we do not consider these securities other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2018. It is reasonably possible that declines in fair value below cost not considered other-than-temporary in the current period could be considered to be other-than-temporary in a future period and earnings would be reduced to the extent of the impairment. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 we incurred impairment charges relating to investments that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, which resulted in impairment charges of $3 million, $1 million and $19 million, respectively. The impairment charges in 2018 and 2017 related to fixed maturity securities of investees entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy which have exhibited a decreasing fair market value and from which we are uncertain of our ability to recover our initial investment. The impairment charges in 2016 related to fixed maturity securities of $13 million, an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate of $3 million, and an other long term investment of $3 million. In each case, we determined the credit risk of the holdings was high and the ability to recover our investment was unlikely. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we held no investment securities for which other-than-temporary impairments had been previously recognized. It is possible that future events may lead us to recognize potential future impairment losses related to our investment portfolio and that unanticipated future events may lead us to dispose of certain investment holdings and recognize the effects of any market movements in our consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued Operations Black Knight As a result of the BK Distribution, the financial results of Black Knight have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We retained no ownership in Black Knight. We have various agreements with Black Knight to provide technology, data and analytics services, as well as corporate shared services and information technology. We are also a party to certain other agreements under which we incur other expenses or receive revenues from Black Knight. We expect to continue utilizing Black Knight to provide technology and data and analytics services for the foreseeable future. Subsequent to the BK Distribution, Black Knight is considered a related party to FNF. The cash inflows and outflows from and to Black Knight as well as revenues and expenses included in continuing operations subsequent to the BK Distribution which were previously eliminated in our consolidated financial statements as intra-entity transactions, are not considered material to our results of operations. A summary of the operations of Black Knight included in discontinued operations is shown below: FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) FNFV As a result of the FNFV Split-Off, the financial results of FNFV Group have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Subsequent to the FNFV Split-Off, Cannae is considered a related party to FNF. The cash inflows and outflows from and to Cannae as well as revenues and expenses included in continuing operations subsequent to November 17, 2017, the date of the FNFV Split-Off, which were previously eliminated in our consolidated financial statements as intra-entity transactions, are not material to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. In conjunction with the FNFV Split-Off, FNTIC, Chicago Title, and Commonwealth Title contributed an aggregate of $100 million to Cannae in exchange for 5,706,134 shares of Cannae common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we own approximately 7.9% of Cannae's outstanding common equity. In addition, we issued to Cannae a revolver note (the \"Cannae Revolver\") in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 450 basis points and matures on the five-year anniversary of the date of the revolver note. The maturity date is automatically extended for additional five-year terms unless notice of non-renewal is otherwise provided by either FNF or Cannae, in their sole discretion. As of December 31, 2018, there is no outstanding balance under the Cannae Revolver. On February 7, 2019, Cannae borrowed $100 million under the Cannae Revolver. In connection with the FNFV Split-Off, the following material agreements were entered into by and between the Company and Cannae (the “Split-Off Agreements”): •a Reorganization Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between the Company and Cannae, which provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Split-Off, certain conditions to the Split-Off and provisions governing the relationship between the Company and Cannae with respect to and resulting from the Split-Off; •a Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between the Company and Cannae, which governs the Company’s and Cannae’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters; and •a Voting Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between the Company and Cannae, pursuant to which the Company agrees to appear or cause all shares of Cannae common stock that the Company or its subsidiaries, as applicable, own after the Split-Off to be counted as present at any meeting of the stockholders of Cannae, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and agrees to vote all of such shares of Cannae common stock (or cause them to be voted) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, all shares voted by holders of Cannae common stock (other than the Company and its subsidiaries).

Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist of the following: Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and computer software, was $119 million, $130 million, and $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the next five years for assets owned at December 31, 2018, is $125 million in 2019, $106 million in 2020, $78 million in 2021, $61 million in 2022 and $43 million in 2023. Note I. Accounts Payable and Other Accrued Liabilities Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities consist of the following: Note J. Notes Payable Notes payable consists of the following: FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) At December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our unsecured notes payable was approximately $868 million, or $18 million higher than its carrying value, excluding $14 million of net unamortized debt issuance costs and premium/discount. The fair values of our unsecured notes payable are based on established market prices for the securities on December 31, 2018 and are considered Level 2 financial liabilities. On August 13, 2018, we completed an offering of $450 million in aggregate principal amount of notes due August 2028 with stated interest of 4.50% per annum (the \"4.50% Notes\"), pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 4.50% Notes were priced at 99.252% of par to yield 4.594% annual interest. The proceeds were used to settle the remaining balance of the Notes (defined below), payoff the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below), and for general corporate purposes. The 4.50% Notes will pay interest semi-annually on the 15th of February and August, beginning February 15, 2019. The 4.50% Notes contain customary covenants and events of default for investment grade public debt, which primarily relate to failure to make principal or interest payments. On June 25, 2013, we entered into an agreement to amend and restate our existing $800 million Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), dated as of April 16, 2012 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”) and the other agents party thereto (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). On April 27, 2017, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended (the \"Restated Credit Agreement\") to extend the term for 5 years, from a maturity date of July 15, 2018 to April 27, 2022. Revolving loans under the credit facility generally bear interest at a variable rate based on either (i) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) 0.5% in excess of the federal funds rate, (b) the Administrative Agent's “prime rate”, or (c) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a margin of between 10 and 60 basis points depending on the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of FNF or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of between 110 and 160 basis points depending on the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of the Company. Based on our current Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Baa2/BBB, respectively, the applicable margin for revolving loans subject to LIBOR is 140 basis points. In addition, we pay a commitment fee of between 15 and 40 basis points on the entire facility, also depending on our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates, limitations on dividends and other restricted payments, a minimum net worth and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the interest rate on all outstanding obligations may be increased, payments of all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. These events of default include a cross-default provision that, subject to limited exceptions, permits the lenders to declare the Revolving Credit Facility in default if: (i) (a) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount (including undrawn committed amounts) in excess of 3.0% of our net worth, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, or (b) we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness, or any other event occurs, as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to its maturity; or (ii) certain termination events occur under significant interest rate, equity or other swap contracts. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Revolving Credit Facility shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate. As of December 31, 2018, there is no balance outstanding, $4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs and $800 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. On August 28, 2012, we completed an offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% notes due September 2022 (the \"5.50% notes\"), pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes were priced at 99.513% of par to yield 5.564% annual interest. The 5.50% notes will pay interest semi-annually on the 1st of March and September, beginning March 1, 2013. These notes contain customary covenants and events of default for investment grade public debt. These events of default include a cross default provision, with respect to any other debt of the Company in an aggregate amount exceeding $100 million for all such debt, arising from (i) failure to make a principal payment when due or (ii) the occurrence of an event which results in such debt being due and payable prior to its scheduled maturity. On August 2, 2011, we completed an offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due August 2018 (the \"Notes\") in an offering conducted in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes matured on August 15, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we settled all of our remaining obligations under the Notes for an aggregate of $211 million. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note K. Income Taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations consists of the following: Total income tax expense was allocated as follows (in millions): A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate is as follows: FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following: Our net deferred tax liability was $227 million and $169 million at December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The significant changes in the deferred taxes are as follows: the deferred tax liability for insurance reserve discounting increased (prior year asset decreased) by $87 million largely due to a change in the treatment of the redomestication of certain of our insurance underwriters as prescribed by the IRS in 2018. The deferred tax liability relating to investment securities decreased by $44 million primarily due to unrealized losses recorded for investment securities. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Reform in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Reform. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded additional benefits to tax expense of $45 million related to a change in tax treatment related to our redomestication of certain of our insurance underwriters. This adjustment has been included in the Tax Reform line of our reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate. At December 31, 2018, we have net operating losses (\"NOL\") on a pretax basis of $31 million available to carryforward and offset future federal taxable income. The net operating losses are US federal net operating losses arising from acquisitions made since 2012, including CINC and ServiceLink. Most of the NOLs are subject to an annual Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation. These losses will begin to expire in year 2022 and we fully anticipate utilizing these losses prior to expiration with the exception of $3 million of gross net operating losses that are offset by a $1 million valuation allowance. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $41 million and $40 million of tax credits, respectively. The credits primarily consist of general business credits from historical acquisitions. We anticipate that these credits will be utilized prior to expiration after a valuation allowance of $21 million on the general business credits. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately $9 million and $11 million (including interest of less than $1 million), respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our income tax rate. We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. In 2018, we reversed $8 million of reserves related to a Florida audit that was closed with a favorable result and we increased our reserve by $6 million for potential state tax liabilities. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has selected us to participate in the Compliance Assurance Program that is a real-time audit. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. We file income tax returns in various foreign and US state jurisdictions. Our state income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018 tax years remain subject to examination by state jurisdictions. Note L. Summary of Reserve for Claim Losses A summary of the reserve for claim losses follows: We continually update loss reserve estimates as new information becomes known, new loss patterns emerge, or as other contributing factors are considered and incorporated into the analysis of reserve for claim losses. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we reduced the current quarter provision for claims losses to 4.5%. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we released excess title reserves of $97 million in addition to reducing the provision for claims losses for the quarter to 5.0%. In response to favorable development on recent year claims, the average provision rate has decreased in each of the years ended 2016, 2017, and 2018. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the process and to the judgment used by management, the ultimate liability may be greater or less than our current reserves. If actual claims loss development varies from what is currently expected and is not offset by other factors, it is possible that our recorded reserves may fall outside a reasonable range of our actuary's central estimate, which may require additional reserve adjustments in future periods. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note M. Commitments and Contingencies Legal and Regulatory Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various pending and threatened litigation matters related to our operations, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. With respect to our title insurance operations, this customary litigation includes but is not limited to a wide variety of cases arising out of or related to title and escrow claims, for which we make provisions through our loss reserves. Additionally, like other companies, our ordinary course litigation includes a number of class action and purported class action lawsuits, which make allegations related to aspects of our operations. We believe that no actions, other than the matters discussed below, if any, depart from customary litigation incidental to our business. We review lawsuits and other legal and regulatory matters (collectively “legal proceedings”) on an ongoing basis when making accrual and disclosure decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, management bases its decision on its assessment of the ultimate outcome assuming all appeals have been exhausted. For legal proceedings in which it has been determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability based on known facts and which represents our best estimate has been recorded. Our accrual for legal and regulatory matters was $11 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. None of the amounts we have currently recorded are considered to be material to our financial condition individually or in the aggregate. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of our pending legal proceedings is generally not yet determinable. While some of these matters could be material to our operating results or cash flows for any particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, at present we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In a class action captioned Patterson, et al. v. Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, et al., Case No. GD 03-021176, originally filed on October 27, 2003 and pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, plaintiffs allege the named Company underwriters violated Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (“UTPCPL”) by failing to provide premium discounts in accordance with filed rates in refinancing transactions. Contrary to rulings in similar federal court cases that considered the rate rule and agreed with the Company’s position, the court held that the rate rule should be interpreted such that an institutional mortgage in the public record is a “proxy” for prior title insurance entitling a consumer to a discount rate when refinancing when there is a mortgage of record within the number of years required by the rate rule. The rate rule requires sufficient evidence of a prior policy, and because not all institutional mortgages were insured, the Company’s position is that a recorded first mortgage alone does not constitute sufficient evidence of an earlier policy entitling consumers to a discounted rate. The court certified the class refusing to follow prior Pennsylvania Supreme Court and appellate court decisions holding that the UTPCPL requires proof of reliance, an individual issue which precludes certification. After notice to the class, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on liability, and defendants moved for summary judgment. On June 27, 2018, the court entered an order granting plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on liability, and denying the Company’s motion finding that the Company failed to advise its agents on how to interpret the rate rule so that it would be uniformly applied, thereby having engaged in “deceptive conduct.” The Company plans to seek interlocutory review of the summary judgment order. The court approved the parties’ stipulation in which they agreed that before interlocutory review is appropriate, the court will first determine which party should bear the burden of ascertaining the class and calculating damages, and determine whether the damages should be trebled. Briefing on these issues is complete and oral argument was held on January 15, 2019. A decision is pending with the court. There has been no determination as to the size of the class. It is unknown whether plaintiffs will seek statutory or actual damages, whether the judge will exercise discretion to award treble damages or award prejudgment interest, or what plaintiffs’ counsel will seek as reasonable attorneys’ fees. Accordingly, damages are not reasonably estimable at this time. We will continue to vigorously defend this matter, and we do not believe the result will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. From time to time we receive inquiries and requests for information from state insurance departments, attorneys general and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries and we have responded to or are currently responding to inquiries from multiple governmental agencies. Also, regulators and courts have been dealing with issues arising from foreclosures and related processes and documentation. Various governmental entities are studying the title insurance product, market, pricing, and business practices, and potential regulatory and legislative changes, which may materially affect our business and operations. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions. Escrow Balances In conducting our operations, we routinely hold customers’ assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions, and are responsible for the proper disposition of these balances for our customers. Certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, consistent with Generally FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Accepted Accounting Principles and industry practice. These balances amounted to $13.5 billion at December 31, 2018. As a result of holding these customers’ assets in escrow, we have ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks. There were no investments or loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 related to these arrangements. Operating Leases We have operating leases for certain of our premises and equipment, primarily for office space in our direct operations. Our operating leases range in term from one to ten years. Most of our leases include one or more options to renew, with varying renewal terms that can extend the lease term. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Rent expense incurred under operating leases during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $150 million, $144 million, and $128 million, respectively. Note N. Regulation and Equity Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries, including title insurers, underwritten title companies and insurance agencies, are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. Each of the insurance underwriters is subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile which regulates, among other matters, the ability to pay dividends and enter into transactions with affiliates. The laws of most states in which we transact business establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to issuing and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, accounting practices, financial practices, establishing reserve and capital and surplus as regards policyholders (“capital and surplus”) requirements, defining suitable investments for reserves and capital and surplus and approving rate schedules. The process of state regulation of changes in rates ranges from states which set rates, to states where individual companies or associations of companies prepare rate filings which are submitted for approval, to a few states in which rate changes do not need to be filed for approval. Since we are regulated by both state and federal governments and the applicable insurance laws and regulations are constantly subject to change, it is not possible to predict the potential effects on our insurance operations, particularly the Title segment, of any laws or regulations that may become more restrictive in the future or if new restrictive laws will be enacted. Pursuant to statutory accounting requirements of the various states in which our insurers are domiciled, these insurers must defer a portion of premiums earned as an unearned premium reserve for the protection of policyholders and must maintain qualified assets in an amount equal to the statutory requirements. The level of unearned premium reserve required to be maintained at any time is determined by statutory formula based upon either the age, number of policies and dollar amount of policy liabilities underwritten, or the age and dollar amount of statutory premiums written. As of December 31, 2018, the combined statutory unearned premium reserve required and reported for our title insurers was $1,412 million. In addition to statutory unearned premium reserves, each of our insurers maintains reserves for known claims and surplus funds for policyholder protection and business operations. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance regulatory authority in its respective state of domicile, as well as that of each state in which it is licensed. The insurance commissioners of their respective states of domicile are the primary regulators of our title insurance subsidiaries. Each of the insurers is subject to periodic regulatory financial examination by regulatory authorities. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions of cash or property to their immediate parent company without prior approval from the Department of Insurance of their respective states of domicile. As of December 31, 2018, $1,518 million of our net assets are restricted from dividend payments without prior FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) approval from the Departments of Insurance. During 2019, our title insurers can pay or make distributions to us of approximately $512 million, without prior approval. The combined statutory capital and surplus of our title insurers was approximately $1,383 million and $1,389 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The combined statutory net earnings of our title insurance subsidiaries were $625 million, $434 million, and $541 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Statutory-basis financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the various state insurance regulatory authorities. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (“NAIC”) Accounting Practices and Procedures manual (“NAIC SAP”) has been adopted as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by each of the states that regulate us. Each of our states of domicile for our title insurance underwriter subsidiaries have adopted a material prescribed accounting practice that differs from that found in NAIC SAP. Specifically, in both years, the timing of amounts released from the statutory unearned premium reserve under NAIC SAP differs from the states' required practice. Statutory surplus at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was lower by approximately $28 million than if we had reported such amounts in accordance with NAIC SAP. As a condition to continued authority to underwrite policies in the states in which our insurers conduct their business, the insurers are required to pay certain fees and file information regarding their officers, directors and financial condition. In addition, our escrow and trust business is subject to regulation by various state banking authorities. Pursuant to statutory requirements of the various states in which our insurers are domiciled, such insurers must maintain certain levels of minimum capital and surplus. Required levels of minimum capital and surplus are not significant to the insurers individually or in the aggregate. Each of our insurers has complied with the minimum statutory requirements as of December 31, 2018. Our underwritten title companies, primarily those domiciled in California, are also subject to certain regulation by insurance regulatory or banking authorities relating to their net worth and working capital. Minimum net worth and working capital requirements for each underwritten title company is less than $1 million. These companies were in compliance with their respective minimum net worth and working capital requirements at December 31, 2018. There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to shareholders although there are limits on the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, as described above. Equity On July 17, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new three-year stock repurchase program effective August 1, 2018 (the \"2018 Repurchase Program\") under which we can purchase up to 25 million shares of our FNF common stock through July 31, 2021. We may make repurchases from time to time in the open market, in block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 660,000 FNF common shares for $21 million or an average of $32.33 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and through market close on February 14, 2019, we repurchased a total of 60,000 shares for $2 million, or an average of $31.83 per share under this program. Since the original commencement of the 2018 Repurchase Program, we repurchased a total of 720,000 FNF common shares for $23 million, or an average of $32.29 per share. Note O. Employee Benefit Plans Stock Purchase Plan During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, our eligible employees could voluntarily participate in our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) sponsored by us. Pursuant to the ESPP, employees may contribute an amount between 3% and 15% of their base salary and certain commissions. We contribute varying amounts as specified in the ESPP. We contributed $25 million, $23 million, and $20 million to the ESPPs in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, in accordance with our matching contribution. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, we have offered our employees the opportunity to participate in our 401(k) profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”), qualified voluntary contributory savings plan which is available to substantially all of our employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 40% of their pretax annual compensation, up to the amount allowed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. We make an employer match on the 401(k) Plan of $0.375 on each $1.00 contributed up to the first 6% of eligible earnings contributed to the 401(k) Plan by employees. The employer match for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $30 million and $26 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and was credited based on the participant's individual investment elections in the FNF 401(k) Plan. Omnibus Incentive Plan In 2005, we established the FNT 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”) authorizing the issuance of up to 8 million shares of common stock, subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan. On October 23, 2006; May 29, 2008; May 25, 2011; May 22, 2013; and June 15, 2016 the shareholders of FNF approved amendments to increase the number of shares for issuance under the Omnibus Plan by 16 million, 11 million, 6 million, 6 million and 10 million shares, respectively. The primary purpose of the increases were to assure that we had adequate means to provide equity incentive compensation to our employees on a going-forward basis. The Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares, performance units, other cash and stock-based awards and dividend equivalents. As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,821,238 shares of restricted stock and 7,543,787 stock options outstanding under this plan. Awards granted are approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Options vest over a 3 year period and have a contractual life of 7 years. The exercise price for options granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. Stock option grants vest according to certain time based and operating performance criteria. Option exercises by participants are settled on the open market. FNF stock option transactions under the Omnibus Plan for 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows: FNF restricted stock transactions under the Omnibus Plan in 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows: The following table summarizes information related to stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2018: We account for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with GAAP on share-based payments, which requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payments be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of each award. Using the fair value method of accounting, compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognized over the service period. Fair value of restricted stock awards and units is based on the grant date value of the underlying stock derived from quoted market prices. The total fair value of restricted stock awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $29 million, $31 million, and $29 million, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock awards which vested in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $29 million, $38 million, and $25 million, respectively. Option awards are measured at fair value on the grant date using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. The intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $19 million, $25 million, and $46 million, respectively. Net earnings attributable to FNF Shareholders reflects stock-based compensation expense amounts of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in personnel costs in the reported financial results of each period. At December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option grants and restricted stock grants is $54 million, which is expected to be recognized in pre-tax income over a weighted average period of 1.62 years. Pension Plans In 2000, FNF merged with Chicago Title Corporation (\"Chicago Title\"). In connection with the merger, we assumed Chicago Title’s noncontributory defined contribution plan and noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”). The Pension Plan covers certain Chicago Title employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s average monthly compensation in the highest 60 consecutive calendar months during the 120 months ending at retirement or termination. Effective December 31, 2000, the Pension Plan was frozen and there will be no future credit given for years of service or changes in salary. The accumulated benefit obligation is the same as the projected benefit obligation due to the pension plan being frozen as of December 31, 2000. Pursuant to GAAP on employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans, the measurement date is December 31. The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 3.90% and 3.34%, respectively. As of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 the projected benefit obligation was $150 million and $166 million, respectively, and the fair value of plan assets was $144 million and $162 million, respectively. The net pension liability and net periodic expense included in our financial position and results of operations relating to these plans is not considered material for any period presented.

Supplementary Cash Flow Information The following supplemental cash flow information is provided with respect to interest and tax payments, as well as certain non-cash investing and financing activities. _____________________________________ (1) See Note B Acquisitions for further discussion of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Note Q. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentration of Risk Title In the normal course of business we and certain of our subsidiaries enter into off-balance sheet credit arrangements associated with certain aspects of the title insurance business and other activities. We generate a significant amount of title insurance premiums in Texas, California, Florida and New York. Title insurance premiums as a percentage of the total title insurance premiums written from those four states are detailed as follows: Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trade receivables. We place cash equivalents and short-term investments with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. Investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up our customer base, thus spreading the trade receivables credit risk. We control credit risk through monitoring procedures. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note R. Segment Information Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables.

Refer to Note G. Discontinued Operations for further information. Note S. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a new comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This update permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations was issued by FASB in March 2016 to clarify the principal versus agent considerations within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing was issued by the FASB in April 2016 to clarify how to determine whether goods and services are separately identifiable and thus accounted for as separate performance obligations. ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients was issued by the FASB in May 2016 to clarify certain terms from the aforementioned updates and to add practical expedients for contracts at various stages of completion. ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, was issued by the FASB in December 2016 which includes thirteen technical corrections and improvements affecting narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09. We adopted these revenue standards on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. As there was no material impact to our historical revenue recognition, we did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the current year. See Note T. Revenue Recognition for further discussion of our revenue. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Other Pronouncements In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The primary amendments required by the ASU include: requiring equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value through net income rather than through other comprehensive income; allowing entities with equity investments without readily determinable fair values to report the investments at cost, adjusted for changes in observable prices, less impairment; requiring entities that elect the fair value option for financial liabilities to report the change in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income; and clarifying that entities should assess the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU requires a cumulative-effect adjustment of the balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Early adoption of the ASU is not permitted, except for the provision related to financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of our unrealized gains and losses on our equity and preferred securities available for sale previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income to beginning retained earnings. Changes in the fair value of our investments in equity and preferred securities subsequent to January 1, 2018 are now included in Realized gains and losses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note D. Investments for further details. We reclassified a total of $109 million from Accumulated other comprehensive income to beginning Retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The total cumulative effect on opening equity, including an increase in Retained earnings of $19 million attributable to an increase in value of certain Other long term investments resulting from recording at fair value, was an increase in Retained earnings of $128 million and decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive income of $109 million. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in this ASU require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. GAAP previously did not include specific guidance on the cash flow classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash. The Company previously excluded cash pledged related to secured trust deposits, which generally meets the definition of restricted cash, from the reconciliation of beginning-of-period to end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented upon adoption. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 and have retrospectively restated our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the following retrospective changes to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively: an increase (decrease) in the net change in cash and cash equivalents of $144 million and $223 million, respectively, due to the inclusion of the change in our cash pledged against secured trust deposits; an increase (decrease) in cash provided by (used in) investing activities of $174 million and $63 million, respectively, related to the movement of cash paid/received for investments pledged against secured trust deposits from operating to investing activities; and an (increase) decrease in cash used in financing activities of $(30) million and $160 million, respectively, related to the movement of the change in secured trust deposits from operating to financing activities. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this ASU allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from Tax Reform. We adopted this ASU on April 1, 2018. Adoption of this ASU resulted in no net reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Retained earnings. Other Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this ASU introduce broad changes to the accounting and reporting for leases by lessees. The main provisions of the new standard include: clarifications to the definitions of a lease, components of leases, and criteria for determining lease classification; requiring virtually all leased assets, including operating leases and related liabilities resulting from applying the fair value measurement, to be reflected on the lessee's balance sheet; and expanding and adding to the required disclosures for lessees. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the standard is permitted. The ASU allows for a modified retrospective approach to transitioning which allows for the use of practical expedients to effectively account for leases commenced prior to the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements which allows entities the option to adopt this standard prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening equity and include required disclosures for prior periods. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) We identified a vendor with software suited to track and account for leases under the new standard and have transitioned our lease accounting within the software. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and result in recording a right-of-use asset of approximately $416 million to $451 million and a lease liability of approximately $431 million to $466 million. While we are still completing our analysis, we do not anticipate that adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. Our primary right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recorded upon adoption primarily relate to our leased office space. We plan to prospectively adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2019 and to use the package of practical expedients available upon adoption. Other In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU introduce broad changes to accounting for credit impairment of financial instruments. The primary updates include the introduction of a new current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model that is based on expected rather than incurred losses and amendments to the accounting for impairment of fixed maturity securities available for sale. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating the effect this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and have not yet concluded on its effects. We do not plan to early adopt the standard. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. The new guidance requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and do not plan to early adopt. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Note T - Revenue Recognition On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 by applying the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The adoption of ASC Topic 606 did not have an impact on the recognition of our primary sources of revenue, direct and agency title premiums, as those revenue streams are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements under ASC Topic 944. Timing of recognition of substantially all of our remaining revenue was also not impacted and we therefore did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to opening equity. Disaggregation of Revenue Our revenue consists of: Our Direct title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue at a point-in-time upon of closing of the underlying real estate transaction as the earnings process is then considered complete. Regulation of title insurance rates varies by state. Premiums are charged to customers based on rates predetermined in coordination with each state's respective Department of Insurance. Cash associated with such revenue is typically collected at closing of the underlying real estate transaction. Premium revenues from agency title operations are recognized when the underlying title order and real estate transaction closing, if applicable, are complete and reported to us. Revenues from our home warranty business are generated from insurance contracts with customers to provide warranty for major home appliances. Substantially all of our home warranty contracts are one year in length and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Escrow fees and Other title-related fees and income in our Title segment are closely related to Direct title insurance premiums and are primarily associated with managing the closing of real estate transactions including the processing of funds on behalf of the transaction participants, gathering and recording the required closing documents, providing notary and home inspection services, and other real estate or title-related activities. Revenue is primarily recognized at a point-in-time upon closing of the underlying real estate transaction or completion and billing of services. Cash associated with such revenue is typically collected at closing. FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) Revenues from ServiceLink, excluding its title premiums, escrow fees, and loan subservicing fees, primarily include revenues from real estate appraisal services and foreclosure processing and facilitation services. Revenues from real estate appraisal services are recognized at a point-in-time when all appraisal work is complete, a final report is issued to the client and the client is billed. Revenues from foreclosure processing and facilitation services are primarily recognized upon completion of the services and when billing to the client is complete. Real estate brokerage revenues are primarily comprised of commission revenues earned in association with the facilitation of real estate transactions and are recognized upon closing of the sale of the underlying real estate transaction. Real estate technology revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees for use of software provided to real estate professionals. Subscriptions are only offered on a month-by-month basis and fees are billed monthly. Revenue is recognized in the month services are provided. Loan subservicing revenues are generated by certain subsidiaries of ServiceLink and are associated with the servicing of mortgage loans on behalf of its customers. Revenue is recognized when the underlying work is performed and billed. Loan subservicing revenues are subject to the recognition requirements of ASC Topic 860. Interest and investment income consists primarily of interest payments received on fixed maturity security holdings and dividends received on equity and preferred security holdings. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, primarily related to revenue from our home warranty business, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. Contract Balances The following table provides information about trade receivables and deferred revenue: Deferred revenue is recorded primarily for our home warranty contracts. Revenues from home warranty products are recognized over the life of the policy, which is primarily one year. The unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $97 million of revenue which was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.<|im_end|>\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and does not currently have revenue-generating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Cruzani, Inc. and Subsidiaries For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and NOTE 1 - BACKGROUND Organization Cruzani, Inc. (“Cruzani” or the “Company”) is currently evaluating strategic options. We have divested ourselves of our current assets and are currently performing due diligence on a wide variety of alternatives. Most recently, we were a franchise development company that builds and represents popular franchise concepts, and other related businesses, throughout the United States as well as international markets. The Company was originally formed as a limited liability company on February 5, 1999 under the name The Powerhouse, L.L.C. pursuant to the laws of the State of Oklahoma. On November 9, 2006, Powerhouse Productions, L.L.C. filed Articles of Conversion changing the entity from a limited liability company to a corporation under the name Harcom Productions, Inc. On January 25, 2010, Articles of Merger were filed with the State of Oklahoma merging U.S. Highland, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation into Harcom Productions, Inc. and the name of the corporation was changed to US Highland, Inc. US Highland, Inc. was a recreational power sports Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), developing motorcycles, quads, single cylinder engines, and v-twin engines under its own brand and for other OEMs. During 2017, the Company exited the recreational power sports OEM and leisure activity vehicles markets. On June 29, 2018, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada to change its name to Cruzani, Inc. The name change is subject to approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as “FINRA”). On June 30, 2018, Supreme Sweets Acquisition Corp. (n/k/a Oventa, Inc.), a subsidiary of the Company, and the Company (collectively, the “Company”) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Supreme Sweets Inc. and 2498411 Ontario, Inc., as sellers (collectively, the “Seller”), pursuant to which in exchange for CAD $200,000 and a twenty percent (20%) interest in Oventa, Inc., the Company agreed to acquire the trade secret assets of Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. A second closing occurred on July 31, 2018, pursuant to which the Company acquired the furniture, fixtures and equipment of Seller in exchange for CAD $100,000. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing delicious snacks, pastries and baked goods with high quality ingredients for exceptional taste, including low calorie and gluten-free alternatives. The Asset Purchase Agreement included a provision, pursuant to which the Company could unwind the transaction if certain milestones were not achieved. The milestones contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement were not met, and accordingly, on December 31, 2018, by written notice to the Seller, the Company unwound the transaction. The capital injected into Oventa, Inc., however, has been secured pursuant to financing statements filed on behalf of the Company, and the Company expects to receive a return of its injected capital of approximately US $339,813 during the calendar year 2019. Collectability is based on claims filed for cash that was paid. On September 27, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Sandrea Gibson, as seller (the “Seller”), and Recipe Food Co., as the target (the “Target”), pursuant to which in exchange for up to CAD $237,000, the Company agreed to acquire 80% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Target from the Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Seller is engaged in the business of preparing and serving delicious, healthy meals on a counter-service basis with high quality ingredients, including low calorie alternatives. Difficulties integrating the Target into the Company group, which forced the Company to cease injecting additional capital into the Target. The Target is currently on the market for disposition to a third-party buyer on an arms-length basis, which the Company can undertake due to its supermajority ownership. On July 8, 2019, Mr. Dickson entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with Conrad Huss to sell 5,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred and 5,000 shares of Series B preferred Stock held by Mr. Dickson. As a result, Mr. Huss acquired the right to vote 99.06 % of the voting control of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock is also convertible into common stock which, in the aggregate, would represent up to .01% of the outstanding common stock after the conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock is also convertible into common stock which, in the aggregate, would represent up to 99.05% of the outstanding common stock after the conversion. On July 8, 2019, Everett Dickson, who had been the sole officer of the Company, resigned as an officer of the Company, and Conrad Huss was appointed the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Huss is the sole beneficial owner of 5,000,000 and 5,000 shares of Series B and C Preferred Stocks, respectively. Mr. Dickson also resigned as a director of the Company, effective on July 8th, 2019. Mr. Dickson’s resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the management of the Company Business Cruzani, Inc. is currently evaluating various strategic options to engage in. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company currently has no cash on hand or other assets Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. There is no net effect as the result of these reclassifications. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Supreme Sweets Acquisition Corp. and TruFood Provisions Co for the year ended December 31, 2018. All financial information has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The subsidiaries have had has been no significant net activity. Receivables At December 31, 2018, the Company had other current assets of $339,813 (Note 1) as a result of it’s now terminated purchase agreement with Supreme Sweets Acquisition Corp, and deposits on acquisition of $85,392 (Note 1) from its stock purchase agreement with Recipe Food Co. The Company has evaluated the collectability of both assets and concluded that the funds will not likely be recovered, and wrote them off during the year ended December 31, 2019. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2018. Income taxes The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. Stock-based Compensation We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (“ASC 505-50”). ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract. We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered. Net income (loss) per common share Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU makes targeted amendments to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This guidance is to be applied using various transition methods such as full retrospective, modified retrospective, and prospective based on the criteria for the specific amendments as outlined in the guidance. The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, and early adoption is permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), which updated through several revisions and clarifications since its original issuance and supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. This guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition, requiring an entity to recognize revenue representing the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The update also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures, beginning in the quarter of adoption, regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, information about contract balances and performance obligations, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract. The update may be applied using one of two prescribed transition methods: retrospectively to the prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”), which eliminates the diversity in practice related to classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which provides guidance that will require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which required computing the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This new guidance will be effective January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies an entity’s ability to modify the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award presented. An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met: the fair value of the modified award has not changed from the fair value on the date of issuance; the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; and, the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company adopted this ASU and it did not have a material impact its financial position and results of operations. In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. This ASU clarifies the recognition, measurement, and effect on earnings per share of certain freestanding equity-classified financial instruments that include down round features affect entities that present earnings per share in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. This new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company has elected to early adopt this ASU and as a result outstanding warrants were not accounted for as a derivative. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going-concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized, and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred recurring losses from operation and does not currently have revenue generating operations. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $79,575,663, and a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1,587,531. However, the Company only used approximately $118,000 to conduct its operations as detailed in the Statement of Cash flows. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations through continuing investments of debt and/or equity by qualified investors/creditors, internally generated working capital and monetization of intellectual property assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is currently pursuing a business strategy which includes raising the necessary funds to finance the Company’s development and marketing efforts. NOTE 4 - OTHER CURRENT ASSET AND DEPOSITS ON ACQUISITION The balances of Other current asset and Deposits on acquisition are as follows: Accounts receivable related to The Company’s aborted acquisition in Supreme Sweets, Inc. The deposits on acquisition were for the purchase of the Recipe Food Company. During 2019, the Company put forth another $17,140 towards this venture. It did not come to fruition and the entire amount was written off. See Note 1- BACKGROUND for more detail., NOTE 5 - LOANS PAYABLE The loan payable balances are as follows: Above notes are past due as of the issuance of these financial statements. NOTE 6 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES The following table summarizes the convertible notes as of December 31, 2019: The embedded conversion options of the Company’s convertible debentures summarized in Note 5, and its convertible preferred Series E stock. contain conversion features that qualify for embedded derivative classification. The fair value of these liabilities is re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value is reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments. The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities: The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for its conversion option liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Binomial option pricing model based on various assumptions. The model incorporates the price of a share of the Company’s common stock (as quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board), volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As, required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations of its derivatives: The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for its conversion option liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Binomial option pricing model based on various assumptions. The model incorporates the price of a share of the Company’s common stock (as quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board), volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As, required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations: The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2019 and 2018. NOTE 7 - WARRANTS In connection with the issuance of the convertible note (the “Note”) with L2 Capital, LLC (“L2”) and funding of the initial tranche of $50,000 on the Note, the Company also issued a common stock purchase warrant to purchase up to 381,905 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms therein as a commitment fee. At the time that each subsequent tranche under the Note is funded by L2 in cash, then on such funding date, the warrant shares shall immediately and automatically be increased by the quotient of 100% of the face value of the respective tranche and 110% of the VWAP of the common stock on the Trading Day (as defined in the Note) immediately prior to the funding date of the respective tranche. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had received multiple tranches for which it issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. These warrants have a variable exercise price per the above and expire in five years. The aggregate fair value of the warrants, which was allocated against the debt proceeds totalled $280,438 based on the Black Scholes Merton pricing model using the following estimates: exercise price ranging from $0.001 - 0.0071, 2.80% - 2.94% risk free rate, 252.42 - 258.24% volatility and expected life of the warrants of 5 years. The fair value was credited to additional paid in capital and debited to debt discount to be amortized over the term of the loan. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock warrants and changes during the periods is presented below: The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for its conversion option liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Binomial option pricing model based on various assumptions. The model incorporates the price of a share of the Company’s common stock (as quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board), volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As, required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations: NOTE 8 - COMMON STOCK During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the company issued shares of common stock as follows: L2 Capital, LLC converted $33,149 of principal into 16,660,864 shares of common stock. Device Corp. converted $9,700 and $1,050 of principal and interest, respectively, into 12,500,000 shares of common stock. The loans from Device Corp have no specific terms of conversion and have therefore not been classified as convertible. The shares were valued on the date of conversion at the closing stock price, for a loss on conversion of debt of $46,250. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued 56,169,737 shares of common stock to settle $259,547 of principal and $19,870 of accrued interest on its convertible notes. On November 20, 2018, the Company and its stockholders approved a 1 for 20 reverse stock split. The reverse stock split was deemed effective by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on January 10, 2019. All shares throughout these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. NOTE 9 - PREFERRED STOCK Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, has a par value of $0.01, may be converted at the holder’s election into shares of common stock at the conversion rate of ten shares of common stock for one share of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share is entitled to 10 votes, voting with the common stock as a single class, has liquidation rights of $2.00 per share and is not entitled to receive dividends. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, there are 3,381,520 and 3,381,520 shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding, respectively. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, has a par value of $0.01, may be converted at the holder’s election into shares of common stock at the conversion rate of 4,000 shares of common stock for one share of Series B Preferred Stock. Each share is entitled to 4,000 votes, voting with the common stock as a single class, has liquidation rights of $0.01 per share and is not entitled to receive dividends. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, there are 5,000 and 5,000 shares of Series B preferred stock outstanding, respectively. Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, has a par value of $0.01, may be converted at the holder’s election into shares of common stock at the conversion rate of 400 shares of common stock for one share of Series C Preferred Stock. Each share is entitled to 400 votes, voting with the common stock as a single class, has liquidation rights of $0.01 per share and is entitled to receive four hundred times the dividends declared and paid with respect to each share of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, there are 5,000,000 and 5,000,000 shares of Series C preferred stock outstanding, respectively. Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, has a par value of $0.0001, may be converted at a ratio of the Stated Value plus dividends accrued but unpaid divided by the fixed conversion price of $0.0015, which conversion price is subject to adjustment. Series D is non-voting, has liquidation rights to be paid in cash, before any payment to common or junior stock, 140% of the Stated Value ($2.00) per share plus any dividends accrued but unpaid thereon and is entitled to 8% cumulative dividends. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, there are 125,000 and 125,000 shares of Series D preferred stock outstanding, respectively. Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, has a par value of $0.001, and a stated value of $1.00 per share, subject to adjustment. The shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock can convert at a conversion price that is equal to the amount that is 61% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 trading days immediately preceding such conversion. The shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock are subject to redemption by the Company at its option from the date of issuance until the date that is 180 days therefrom, subject to premium that ranges from 120% to 145%, increasing by 5% during each 30-day period following issuance. Series E carries a 12% cumulative dividend, which will increase to 22% upon an event of default, is non-voting, and has liquidation rights to be paid in cash, before any payment to common or junior stock. The Series E are mandatorily redeemable after twelve months, and therefore have been classified as mezzanine equity. On July 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Device Corp. (“Device”) whereby Device will purchase up to $250,000 Series E preferred stock for $1 per share. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has received $166,331 for the purchase of the Series E. Originally, these purchases were recorded as debt because the Preferred shares were not issued. As of the Balance sheet date and the date of this report, these shares have not been issued to the Purchaser. As such, the Company feels these securities should be classified as Mezzanine equity until they are fully issued. On January 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Geneva Roth Remark Holdings, Inc. (“Geneva”) whereby Geneva will purchase 53,000 shares of Series E preferred stock for $53,000. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, there are 34,985 and 53,000 shares of Series E preferred stock outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company fair valued its Series E preferred stock derivative liability at $40,000. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, Geneva Roth Remark Holdings converted 18,01515 Series E preferred shares into 194,438,842 shares of common stock. During the third quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, Mr. Huss sold $15,000 worth of Series E preferred to other investors. NOTE 10 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its Series C Preferred stock to Everett Dickson, the Company’s former CEO for services rendered. The stock was valued based on the services performed for total non-cash expense of $120,000. Per the terms of Mr. Dickson’s employment agreement, he is to be compensated $120,000 per year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, he was paid $52,000, and $68,000 has been credited to accrued compensation. Mr. Dickson’s employment was terminated effective June 30, 2019 due to the change of control. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, he was paid $16,000. As of December 31, 2019, $112,000 has been credited to accrued compensation. On July 8, 2019, the Company executed an employment agreement with Conrad Huss, the new CEO. The agreement is effective for three months with a salary of $10,000 per month. As of December 31, 2019, $30,000 has been credited to accrued compensation. NOTE 11 - INCOME TAX In accordance with ASC 740, we are required to recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. We had no unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. It is also our policy, in accordance with authoritative guidance, to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest and other expense in our Statements of Operations. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. As a result of our cumulative losses, management has concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% is being used from 2018 due to the new tax law recently enacted. The provision for income taxes on our loss from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: Note: The marginal tax rate is calculated as follows: As percentages of net income, the following are the components of tax expense: At December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $8,380,000 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2020 to 2039. No tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2019 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Our operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years due to the transfer of preferred securities from our former Chief Executive to our current Chief Executive, Conrad R Huss. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013. NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES During the normal course of business, the Company may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation, it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20-50, Contingencies. The Company evaluates its exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes the necessary accruals. On September 21, 2018, Pro Drive Outboards, LLC (“Pro-Drive”) filed a lawsuit against the Company, in which Pro-Drive alleges that the Company breached a contract that Pro-Drive entered into with the Company. Pro-Drive is seeking damages in excess of $500,000. The Company has filed an answer, including the defenses of defective service of process and statute of limitations and a motion to dismiss. The judge granted a motion to dismiss, and the plaintiff’s deadline to appeal has passed, thus concluding the matter. On February 13, 2017, Baum Glass & Jayne PLLC (“Plaintiff”) obtained a default judgment against the Company in the amount of $27,083.74. Plaintiff has not attempted enforced collection. The amount was included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. On June 20, 2018, GW Holdings Group, Inc. (“GW”) filed a lawsuit against the Company, in which GW alleges that the Company breached two Stock Purchase Agreements that GW entered into with the Company. On July 11, 2018, the Company filed a motion to dismiss which was granted by the court on March 13, 2019. A notice of appeal filed by GW is pending. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has a note payable balance of $60,750 due to GW. Since GW’s original complaint has been dismissed and no further action has been taken by the court, no additional liability has been accrued. NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that no material subsequent events exist other than the following. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, Oasis Capital, LLC loaned the Company $9,200, to cover general operating costs. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company issued 121,276,346 shares for the extinguishment of convertible debt. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company issued $125,000 in notes for consulting services and $15,600 in notes for general corporate purposes.<|im_end|>\n",
